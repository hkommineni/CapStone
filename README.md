## Presents an Omni-Channel, Multi-Media Customer Service Streaming Experience
To seemlessly transition customer relations to an organic, mutually-beneficial and data-driven process.
We brought together innovation, thinking, learning, doing, and just the right amount of coffee to create an absolutely stunning finished product.

## Purpose
We set out to create a video streaming solution. **What we came up with was way more than just that.** We created a total platform based around 
video streaming. We created a revolutionary way for customer service representatives to interact with any customer in need. This site is 
a central hub for all customer service interactions -- a social media platform where customer and customer service representatives can come 
together and solve problems. 

This site enables customer service representatives to livestream video to customers in need or to post videos regarding frequently asked 
questions -- there is no easier way to get information than to be told aloud. A phone call is impersonal and often involves robots and the
iconic lady-computer voice. **We ditched all that.** We set out to put the personality back into customer service and there is no better way
to do that than face-to-face.
